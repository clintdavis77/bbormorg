Kenny Heinzel is the pastor at Bethel Baptist Church of Rocky Mount. He has been in the ministry over twenty years, previously serving at Luthersville Baptist Church and East Newnan Baptist Church. When he isn’t at church, you can usually find him in his workshop working on something that will be sure to be overbuilt, hence his nickname of “Heavy Duty”. He lives in Newnan with his wife, Robyn, and enjoys spending time with his kids and grand kids. Feel free to contact him at <a href="mailto:kenny@bborm.org">kenny@bborm.org</a> or through the <a href=/#call-to-action>contact form</a>.
