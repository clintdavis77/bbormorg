## Machine Generated Transcript

Well, good morning. Good to have you with us again on Sunday morning. As you come to worship with us over the Internet. We like I said, continuing to do this and we're hearing. A lot of good report side of it. So as long as it is ministering and getting the gospel out we'll do this as long as the Lord leads us to do it we're glad today that our senior adult class started back there Sunday school class.

If you'd like to join them next Sunday at nine and 45 they're meeting our fellowship all for the senior adult. So we're excited about that. We got that one back going, we're looking at our children's programs and when we will begin to have them start back in on Wednesday night. So we are slowly. But surely getting back to all of our programs going and just wanting to be cautious and be sure that we're doing it the right way and doing it the best time as the Lord leads.

So we'll give you updates on that and look for post on our Facebook page. Or our website of the calendar of events that will be taking place. But just thankful again to have you with us this morning. As we study guys were if you would this morning turn into your Bibles to James. Chapter one, James chapter one, and you put your finger there we'll start there.

And then we're going to look at some verses and John chapter eight. So we'll look at James. One and John chapter eight today and what I want to talk to you about. There is a lot going on in our world today as you all know and a lot of confusion. A lot of people saying this is what's going on. A lot of people saying that's what's going on.

This is the truth. Now, this is the truth and everybody seems to have their own ideas of what the truth is. And it appears that nobody knows what the truth is. I mean it's very difficult to look at what's going on in our world and to decipher and to know who to trust and who to to believe. And is this of God or is this of Satan or is this just evil?

I think a lot of what you're seeing is just pure evil. There are good. God is working and as I've said before, God can even use bad things for his purpose. But I want to help you maybe today to just try to identify what is evil, how would us as Christians now to look at something and say is this of God or is this been defeated or been deceived by Satan?

I thought about this too. Maybe I should add another one. Or am I just being deceived by myself? We all by ourselves. Are enough problem without putting Satan in there. A lot of times. So just keep that in mind. But today I want to focus on maybe God versus Satan. How do they operate? How do they appear? How do we know if God is telling us something or of Satan is just deceiving it first.

I want to go and we got to just get to the root of this and understand you just have to bear with me some of this morning. Understand temptations to do things temptations to believe things as you are being told and where it all comes from how it comes about. So, James, chapter one we're going to start reading in verse 12 it says Blessed is the man that Endureth temptation.

Now, James is saying a temptation is not bad. A matter of fact. Those who go through temptation are blessed, you say. Well, I don't feel very blessed, I don't like going through temptation and I've even heard some people say oh, if you're tempted you sin, not necessarily not yet. You may, but just because your attempted doesn't mean you see in here doesn't mean that you're a terrible person.

It's says Blessed is he who endure a temptation for when he has tried remember that the temptation. And then he goes on and says when he has tried there seems to be two different things. We'll talk about that in a minute he shall receive a crown of life which the Lord has promised to them that love him.

Let no man say when he is tempted. I am tempted of God for God cannot be tempted with evil. Neither tempt the any man. But every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust. And enticed and then when less has conceived it

Bringeth forth sin and sin. When it is finished Bringeth forth death do not air. My beloved brother James is speaking to the elders or to the church here and it is just an overall addressing not to any particular church. But just to the body of Christ, he says you got to understand this. Just because you're tempted it's not always bad there's a difference between temptation and trials being tried or being tested.

And he said if you come out of that temptation or you come out of that trial, as God would have you to there's a reward for you interesting isn't it a lot of people think. Well I'm tempted I'm doomed. I say if you're tempted and you come through according to the will of God there's a reward. So what does all this mean let's just break this down.

He says first we need to understand when temptations come and we all get tempted to do one thing or another in your life. You are tempted to do wrong as we naturally think. But you're tempted to believe certain things you're tempted to buy things you're attempted to go certain places, there are temptations.

There are things that come to you every day and that's why I believe the scripture tells us to bring every thought into subjection of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ a thought. It starts out as a temptation. And then you think about it. So it says take that thought and basically say Jesus, what would you have me do with this thought or with its temptation?

So with that, God allows temptation. We see that in job. Chapter one where Satan comes before God and they have a conversation. And God basically just says if you considered my servant job and he basically gives Satan the approval to tempt Joe, well, Satan will tempt and deceive. But God test, God used it as a test as a way of teaching.

Satan may be using it as a way to deceive you to get to do wrong because see Satan's ultimate goal with Joe was get him to deny God. When he said, have you considered my servant job, a righteous man. All sure's righteous sure follows. You sure he trusts you you've given him everything he's got you put a hedge of protection around him.

Absolutely, he will. So God's thing was was to test job and test Joe's faith to see to show Joe where he stood with God. But to show Satan where he stood with God, but then Satan's ultimate goal. And you look at this here. God is using it to test and to teach and to build a stronger faith and then that'd be one key thing to understand.

And when you're trying to side, is it or is it Satan? Is this going to help me be a better person. Is this going to draw me closer to my lord and savior? Is this going to help me learn to follow or to trust God's leading in my life, if it is, then that may be a good sign. But is this temptation going to ultimately lead me further away from God or lead me further away from what I know.

The truth will be and that's the goal of Satan. He wants to lead you away. He wants you to deny Christ he wants you to deny God and to do your own selfish Cleavers and that's what he wanted with Joe. See a temptation is it could be an opportunity to accomplish a good thing, but it can be done in a bad way.

You got to bear with me here and you got to follow me on this because I want you to understand and understanding sin and temptation. It helps us give a glimpse of how God works and how Satan works. So a temptation is an opportunity to accomplish maybe a good thing. Or maybe a good thing in a bad way.

And it could be out of the wheel of God. I mean, for example, you take a test in school. You take a test or maybe some of you have to have an ongoing classes at your work and you've got to take a test to see what you know and that's another thing with God, God already knows you. He already knows what you're going to do.

Usually almost always the test is to reveal to you. What you know about you? God already knows about you. God reveals to you where you're at through these tests. So you take a test wherever you're at school or whatever and that's a thing that you can go through and, of course it's not wrong to have an examination but what if you say?

Well, I just don't know it. I just don't have it all down? And you can see your buddies paper over there. And you want to cheat to pass the test to get it right? You want to go another route other than put down what you know? So you've taken an opportunity to accomplish good and now you begin to do it in a bad way and you make it a bad thing.

It is not bad to take a test it is not bad to want to pass an examination but it is bad to do it in the wrong way. Why is it wrong to eat? How about that absolutely it's not wrong to eat. That is a God given the way we are great. We got to eat for nutrients there's nothing wrong with eating and we are tempted to eat.

We have a desire within us to eat. But if our desire says hey go to the market and steal the food to have to eat, then it's a good thing in a bad way. I hope that it clears that up and helps you to understand that temptations are not always bad. We make them bad by the actions. We take on them let's go on, look down what he says.

He says, as I said, he says here in verse 14 but everyone is tempted and is drawn away of its own lust and desires. Okay, a lot of you hold the lust. Preacher. Love you, can't say lust in church, oh, absolutely, you can. The Bible says it. So I can see it. But lust is basically an inward desire for anything. So if you don't like the word less you can just put desire every man they're drawn away of his own desires it's not a bad thing to have desires.

As I said, desire to eat the desire to want to do good and all these things. But how you go about it? What is your ultimate motivation for it? Is it pleasing to God or is it pleasing to yourself? I guess I would put desires. And I compared to maybe you remember the old locomotives steam engines. The steam in that locomotive is desire that's not a bad thing that's what drives it?

The locomotive desire is what drives us to be better to do better. And to accomplish goals in life there's nothing wrong with desire there's nothing wrong with that steam that's what gives it its power? That's what gives it its a movement to go? And to work and to fulfill its mission without the desire without the steam, you don't have any power.

So God gives us an inner desire to serve him and inner desire to please him and enter the desire to do good and to love their neighbor as ourselves and through. That comes the power that motivates us to keep going and to do things. So just like the steam, you can compare that to desire. But when you have steam in this locomotive and say the engineer is just not paying attention to the gauges and he's supposed to be at a certain temperature or a certain pressure.

And it starts getting way out of control now this steam. That was good for this locomotive becomes a major issue because it's becoming out of control. The engineer must control how much heat is in the fire how much steam is being led off for the load that's taking place was the same way with our desire when our desires become overwhelming.

And so selfish that we can't concentrate on anything but what we want and what we want to do and we never focus on what God wants to do. Then our desires become a problem. They become out of control. So desire and steam must be well desire and steam must be kept in control or there be devastating reactions from it, so desire and steam under must be kept under constant control to be productive.

So I hope you see that the desire necessarily is not a bad thing, it is a good thing that drives you. That gives you the power that gives you the force to accomplish what God has for you. But it must be kept in check. It must be kept in control to be productive to be what God would have you to be to glorify him.

So that is desire not necessary, anything wrong with temptation there's not anything wrong with desire. But here we get a little deeper into it. He used the words after that enticed with your own desires and enticed. Now it gets tricky now. Enticed. If you look it up in the Greek word and it's a big word.

And I can't even pronounce it, but it basically means to bait. Or like, if you're a fisherman to bet a hook or a hunter would be a trap. They put a pretty little worm with all kinds of sparkles and everything on this hook and there's the fish. And he just he's just like WoW that's got to be good to eat, you know, they put flavors on it and make it smell and glitter and it's just so attracting to that fish.

Now, if it was just a hook bad he probably don't bite just the hook. But, boy, when you put that pretty warm on there now, you got something and he'll bite that worm. Not ever even knowing that the hook is there and the consequences are devastating to the fish. He is then the bites, the hook, not even knowing that he's entangled and trapped that he can't get out he's been enticed to do this thing.

And when you're enticed by this by what you see your desires and you look and you see and you're enticed by it. And then you just don't even focus on the consequences of it. And the consequences of our actions that are apart from God or the consequences of sin. And the what are the consequences of sin?

We look on down and it tells that it brings us death. But he goes on to explain in verse 15 he says then when lust or desire has conceived he starts. Bring it out like a birth of a child once it's conceived you can't change it. You can't there's nothing to be done. There is a human life there. If you look at how he's bringing this into its conceived.

When your desires and your is enticed. And you see what you want. And I got to have it whatever it is. And you don't look at the consequences. You don't look at the big picture of it. You don't pray and ask God. What would you have me do in this situation? Or you make a decision that selfish that self centered it's only what you want.

He says it brings for sin. It just brings forth sin and seeing one in his finish Bringeth forth death so our list or desire becomes. Our will we act on our will? And the action is born. We begin to act on our desire. Our well says I want it, I act upon it it's conceived. I go through it. And if it's out of the will of God it's out of control and it's called sin I hope that makes sense.

Is that pretty clear that when our will is out of control and it's out of the will of God is called sin and sin brings death sin brings destruction and he warns is the ones that he's writing to her. Do not air in understanding this. This is how sin comes about it first just as a desire. And there's nothing wrong with the desire there's nothing wrong with the temptation.

But the action or when our will and our selfishness overcomes that then it is born into sin. So we see here in the very first sin. The same example Satan tempted Eve with a desire. She had a natural desire to want to eat. Well, he says, we'll eat of this fruit and it'll be good for you. Oh, no, I can't eat that fruit.

God says in the day that I eat that fruit, I will surely die. Now, the desire to eat is not bad to the desire to eat a good looking. I don't think it was an Apple may have been, but a good shiny, crunchy at wood. That's good. But the problem is God said, don't so when you have your desires overcome. What God says is true or God says is low.

Then it's wrong to eat it's not wrong to eat at all. But it's wrong to eat what God says. Not to eat it's not wrong to have desires at all. But it's wrong to have and to act upon those desires that God says no, he says in the next part when he's talking to Eve says Oh, when you eat of this, he God knows that you want to have knowledge of good and evil, anything wrong with having knowledge.

Absolutely not James tells us later in his book. He says if any of you like knowledge if you like wisdom ask of God who gives freely but knowledge apart from God, apart from God's will apart from God's law is not good it's a bad thing. But knowledge in and of itself is not bad. So I'm hoping these examples help you sort of understand these scriptures.

The result of Eve desire to eat and to eat of something God said not to actually gave her the knowledge that she would see sin for what it was then really sin is anything that you do contrary to the law of God. Okay, now I said in the beginning, God versus Satan. How do they work? We got to understand this part how the human mind thinks how Satan entices us how temptations work to believe to act whatever we do.

How all these things work. And, James, I think spells it out very clearly here. It talks about Paul talks to the Corinthians. The second Corinthians 11 3 he says. But I fear lest by any means as the serpent Beguiled E through civility. So your mind should be corrupt from the simplicity of Christ. Now he's sort of talking about another thing, but he mentions Eve here.

And he mentions how Satan works Begal is to deceive. He deceived Eve. He saw her desire that she wanted and she took something that was good and deceived her. And to believe in a lie and he did it suddenly that the word suddenly means its cunning Craftiness it's

a false presentation of a truth. Yes it's true. She desires to eat. Yes it's true that God said, don't eat this. But God said if you don't eat, if you eat it, he knows you're going to know good and evil and you'll become as gods. He began to lie to her. See what God says don't eat. Why do he say don't eat? I think it was just a test Satan use that test to tempt to entice through our own, her own natural desires to make her sin against the law of God that's how sin is born that's how sin works?

And now I want to get into. What are we looking at today? What are we seeing with all understanding how sin and how Satan works and how God is working. What do we believe? What do we take as Christians and say this is right and that's wrong. How do we know for sure who's speaking the truth and who's lying, how do we know where these things come from?

We see it in videos today. Just like Satan, Beguiled and suddenly or falsely presented the truth to Eve, we see it in videos today. I mean they'll take a video and they'll play. Just a certain part of it. And portray it as true. Sadly there's a lot of that going on today they'll take bits and pieces and clips of things and put them together.

And if you just watch it, you think. Wow that's exactly what took place. But if you take the whole video of everything that transpired within its context and look at it the truth comes out totally opposite from that. See Satan works that way. Satan takes bits and pieces of God's word and turns it into a lie.

So that you would believe his life. So you would follow him. So you would do what he wants you to do. But God puts his everything. He wants us to know is right here. This is the complete context but Satan takes bits and pieces of it and turns it into a lie to deceive you and deceive me and deceive thousands as we're seeing.

I believe Satan is we look at all this and the evil in the world and all bad. And how can people be so evil because Satan is evil. And Satan has got a major influence on our world today and it's getting worse and worse and worse. And it's going to continue to get worse. The more we don't acknowledge, what truth is, what God says and we're just going to follow our own selfish desires and we're enticed by whatever we want to believe and we have no foundation.

We don't want to fall on a truth. But just go by our feelings and our emotions will believe a lie, we believe a lie. Our nation is believing a lot of lies right now and y'all know me. There are no me very closely. I try very hard to stay out of politics. But it is hurting me of the lives that are being told.

And the things that are being said in the the video clips that are being played in the demonstrations that are being done that are all just like they're enticing you to get politicians are enticing you to get what they want to get reelected to get this past to get an uproar to get it's a lie to get their own selfish desire that's exactly the way Satan does that's exactly the way Satan works and we must be careful.

We must not believe this. You say so, brother Kenny. What can I believe? How can I know what is true. How do I know if it's God's will or if it's Satan's well, we look at the temptation of Christ and as much the same way as it was, even it was a temptation did Christ in absolutely not, but Satan took that temptation.

Christ had been fastened for 40 days and 40 nights, do you reckon he was hungry? He took a natural desire and a temptation to want to eat and Satan says you take these stones and turn them into bread and I'll give you this. Remember that see Satan always will take a temptation and he says if you do this, look what you can have.

He did this three times with our savior? If you'll do this I'll give you all the kingdoms of the world if you do this. And every time Christ would answer him with God's. Word with the truth. That is in God's word, what God said and he came out victorious over the temptation. He didn't yield to his own selfish desires, but yielded to the word.

The true word of God to bring him through these temptation. And through this trial, see Satan always offers a deal with the temptation he's always going to offer you something material. It makes me think I know you might have a lot of friends or maybe even had relatives before that says to you, just take care of yourself.

You don't worry about anybody else. Well, maybe that sounds all right. But to me, personally, is a believer I take care of me and I take care of my family. But I worry about God and what he wants me to do what he thinks. I should do that's to somebody else that I worry about. I don't just go through life and just I'm gonna do whatever best for Kenny I'm gonna do I'm looking out for number one that's not the way we live our life as Christians.

Yeah, we do the best we can. We look out for best we can, but ultimately, we bring all things to God. We seek his will and his desire for our life Satan appeals to our natural desire. Our Godgiven desire Satan appeals to those he knows our weaknesses and and things that we really want deep inside us and he takes those things and he turns them into a live.

He offers to tips our desires that spark our emotions or spark our wheels. I mean, you're hearing. All these things going on and people are telling you or showing you exactly what you want to hear and all along they're lying to you about the truth. Because they know it's feeding your emotions. They know it's feeding your own selfish desires, Christians.

We must be careful. Satan is very crafty. Satan is very deceitful. He is a master at this as we'll. See in just a minute. He

never lets our desires or emotions

and to know the truth of our actions. In other words, our desires and our emotions. He just gets all that worked up and leaves it right there. But I'll tell you the consequences of it that's how one way you really know? If is it Satan? You don't think about the consequences I'm just gonna do it I'm gonna.

Take care of me. I have this gonna make me feel good. This is gonna make me happy. So I'm gonna do I'm gonna go by that 80,000 dollars car when I make 20,000 dollars a year, you see what I'm saying, I'm gonna buy this big house because it's gonna make me look good to everybody. Not ever thinking that the payment is going to come due in 30 days.

The consequences of your action see Satan just wants you to get the car, but don't think about the payment. Don't think about the insurance. Don't think about the upkeep. Don't think about any of that. That's how Satan works just speed your own selfish desire? You take care of number one. You take care of you that's how Satan works?

And, you know, Satan also has no desire at all to go with you through your situation. Once he traps you and entices you and get you in his trap. You know what he does he moves on to the next fellow to see if he can trick him and they'll leave you hanging to deal with the consequences all by yourself? I believe that's why many people are broken and emotionally depressed because they've done things in their lives.

Or it may be made decision. And they get so down and out of the circumstances. How did I get myself in? How did I do such a thing where Satan where's the one that tempted you where's the one that gave your Godgiven desires and entice you and tricked you and lie to you. That this was going to be good for you that you would be happy if you did this that this all was going to work out in your benefit.

These are all lies of Satan and he leaves you alone.

It brings bondage. It just brings bond as Jesus said in John 8 34 he says Verily I saying to you whosoever committed. Sin is a servant of sin. If you live your life like that, do you run up your credit cards? You run up your debt. You know what you are you're a servant to debt you'll work. The rest of your life trying to get out of it because you never once considered the consequences.

You never considered asking God to show you and direct you of the things you should do and to keep you from these desire, selfish desires. So what does God do? God does not tempt. As James says, a tempt is no man he tests us and then his test. He reveals to us where we are spiritually where our faith may be where we are as a person he's helping to build character where Satan I want to destroy and to bring you down and to be defeated, God is wanting to bring you up.

God doesn't make deals you need to remember that, you know, a lot of times we want to make deal. God, if you answer this prayer for me I'll go to church from now on and I'll never miss a Sunday. You ever wonder why God never answered those prayers because God doesn't make deals. God is not in the deal making business God will reveal to you the truth of his word and the consequences.

If you don't follow that truth, you said well, brother Kenny that's awful harsh. Well, it may be and I guess as a little child, I thought my daddy was awful harsh. When my daddy was much like God in that way, he didn't come on, so I tell you what, Kenny, if you'll go to bed on time tonight, you can have ice cream tomorrow night.

Now, my daddy said go to bed, boy, and that was law and that's all I got. But I learned as I went through my childhood days. And as I grew up that my daddy what may seemed harsh to me when he would just give me a command to do it and obey was because he loved me. And he wanted what was best for me, he didn't make deals with me and we see this with our politicians.

We see this in our world today and it's nothing but come from Satan himself making deals to get your own selfish desires making deals to get what you want. That's the way Satan operates that's not the way God operates. He doesn't tempt us with pleasures or God. Doesn't he offers consequences, do this and it'll be well, we do this it's not going to go so well for you.

He just lays it out like it is there's no tempt there's no enticing. It is the truth. It is what it is that's how God operates. And these are just a few points of the differences. I know between God and Satan. But the last one I really like is God says, I'll never leave you nor forsake you even in this temptation.

If your desires overcome and your actions, make you do something wrong. God says I'm a god of second chances. I love you I'm going through this with you all the way. I'll never leave you. I'll never forsake you. I'll make a way for you. If you'll trust me were seeing brings bondage God breaks freedom. God will bring you freedom to live and to live a life more abundantly to live a life.

Where when you see one thing or hear one thing God's Holy Spirit will review you the truth to you that if you'll just trust him if you'll just follow him he'll guide you in all truth, the Bible promises is that? And finally, I just want to close real quickly. So, brother Kenny, why don't I feel like I hear God speaking here again, this is God's word and go to John chapter eight.

Order to read you a few verses here. You make the decision for yourself. Where are you at see, the Jesus was talking to the Pharisees here and John chapter and start in verse 42 Jesus said to them. If God were your father, you would love me, do you love Jesus? Do you love his people? Do you love your neighbor as yourself?

Do you pray for your enemies? Do you pray for those who use you Despitefully use you. If you love me you'll love them. He said I proceeded forth and came from God. Jesus says I came from God. Neither came I of myself, but he sent me he's talking to these Pharisees here. The Pharisees that wanted to kill him.

He says why do you not understand my speech Jesus says he says, it's even because you cannot hear my word, you don't hear the truth. Because you don't know the truth. You can't see the truth. You are enticed and deceived by Satan himself. You you wouldn't know the truth. If it fell in your lap

for you or your father, the devil, not my words. That's what Jesus says you can't hear me. Because the one you're following is Satan himself. You're following your own selfish desires. You're following your own lust and selfishness. To get what you want, get all you can and look out for number one. He said you can't even hear me.

You can't even know the truth. Because you're too focused on you and not me. It's pretty tough isn't it you're the father, the devil and that's what he says and the lust or those desires of your father, you will do look what his desire Satan's desires are. He was a murderer from the beginning. Satan has come to steal and to kill and to destroy and he abode.

Not in the truth. He doesn't want to know the truth. I gotta believe that Satan's got to know he loses in the end. But he doesn't want to know that he says he abode not in the truth because there was no truth in him when he speaks a lie. He speaks of his own for. He is a liar and the father of it. Wow, and he says, you're just like your father.

When you act just like he does when you use enticing words to get your own selfish pleasures to get your own selfish desires, you use trickery.

Preachers, politicians businessmen when it becomes all about you you're in dangerous territory you're in a dangerous situation. And you will answer to Almighty God one day for your actions, not my words. I just want to be a humble Messenger to warn you. We need to turn to God we need to seek his face to seek his will in our lives to give up our own selfish desires and not be deceived and let us stray by Satan,

he says. And because I tell you the truth, you will not believe me. I believe with all my heart today, I have told you the truth and many of you are listening by the Internet or wherever you're at you still won't believe me you're so entangled enticed with a lie. You just can't see the truth. I'm praying for you.

Jesus is praying for you that you will know the truth. And the truth will set you free, father. We thank you for your word. We thank you for the truth. The foundation of all that we know and everything that we are is in your word and if we just look to you and trust you for all that we are and to die to ourselves, take up our cross and follow you, Lord that's all that you ask of us, Lord, help us as Christians to do that in our homes.

Help us as a nation to do that just to put you first and foremost and all that we say and all that we do to acknowledge you as the Supreme authority. The one that is all true the one that will never leave us nor forsake us and the one that we can trust father help us to turn to you to know what we should do in all these situations and things that are going on in our personal lives and in our nation by the God.

Please forgive us, please help us to turn back to you to give us peace and to give us the joy that you want us to have in Jesus name, I pray Amen.
