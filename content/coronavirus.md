## Coronavirus Update

### May 17, 2020
We are currently having in-person services at our normal 11am time on Sundays. Precautions have been taken and every other pew has been blocked for social distancing. Families should distance at least 6 feet from other families not living in the same household. For those not comfortable joining, we will be recording the sermons and posting them on our Facebook page.

On June 14, the Senior Sunday School will start back at 9:45am on Sunday's with social distancing measures in place.

The situation is still changing and things may change again in the future. We will update this site and our Facebook page as they do.
