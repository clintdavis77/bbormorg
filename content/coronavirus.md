## Coronavirus Update

### April 4, 2020
Hi Church!

I’m sure you’ve all hear about the governor’s order for sheltering in place. Due to that we are continuing our suspension of in-person church activities through April 13.

Keep in touch with your deacons and let them know if you need any assistance during these times. We will update with any changes as soon as we know.


### March 19, 2020

Based on the current situation and requests from the Governor and President, the Deacons and Pastor have decided to suspend all services and activities through April 4. We will make a decision about the April 5th Sunday Service at a later time.

Keep praying for the country and our local community as we go through this situation. Deacons will be staying in touch with their families and feel free to call them anytime. 

### March 15, 2020

With the recent updates on the Coronavirus and Governor Kemp asking for public gatherings to suspend we have decided to cancel services for Sunday (3/15) and Wednesday (3/18). This includes Sunday morning service, Sunday school, children’s church, and Wednesday night meeting. There will be more updates about future services later in the week. 

Members - Keep in contact with your assigned deacons if you need anything.

Visitors/Community - You can use the contact form to contact us.
